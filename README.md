# DigitsBot

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to DigitsBot! 

DigitsBot started off as a Discord music bot that allows you to enjoy music in your servers. I'm glad you're here, and I'm excited to introduce you to this project.

## Adding DigitsBot to Your Server

To add DigitsBot to your Discord server, simply click on the following link: [Add DigitsBot to Your Server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096964083305173072&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## Available Commands

- `/play [song name]`: Use this command to search for a song. The bot will display four options, and you can simply press a number from 1 to 4 to play your desired song.

- `/stop`: Use this command to stop the song that is currently playing.

- `/addresponse [img/video/gif url or text]`: Use this command to add a response for the bot to automatically send whenever someone @ you inside a text channel.

## Current Status

I want to be transparent about the current state of DigitsBot. Right now, the music aspect of the bot may be a bit slow due to hosting service limitations taking up to 15 seconds the first time a song is ever played on the bot and about 2-3 seconds once the bot has played that song already. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience.

## Future Developments

I am actively working on new implementations and improvements to make DigitsBot even better. Stay tuned for exciting updates and enhancements!

## Get Involved
