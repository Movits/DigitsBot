Running the Bot on Raspberry Pi - Step by Step:

1. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - Navigate to your bot's directory:
     cd /path/to/DigitsBot
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     source myenv/bin/activate

2. Run the Bot Script:
   - Run your bot's main script:
     python3 DigitsBot.py

3. Running Continuously:
   - To keep the bot running continuously, use a tool like 'screen' or 'tmux':
     - Start a new screen session:
       screen
     - Run the bot inside the screen session:
       python3 DigitsBot.py
     - Detach from the screen session (keeping it running):
       Press Ctrl-A, then Ctrl-D

4. Reattach to Screen (if needed):
   - If you need to return to the screen session:
     screen -r

5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (when done):
   - If you exit the bot or need to deactivate the virtual environment:
     deactivate

Remember to replace '/path/to/DigitsBot' with the actual path to your bot's directory.
